/*Pop!

by Reid Perkins-Buzo

This game was written entirely in C++ and compiled in Adobe's Crossbridge C++ compiler. The SWF file resulting from the compile plays with Flash Player 11.5 or better (it uses multi-threading). The source files can be downloaded as a zip archive here.

If you're using C++ and the FlasCC way of making SWFs, this code may help you solve a programming problem or two. Click on the red button to toggle open the printf column on the left side of the game. This provides a glimpse into what the code is doing behind the scenes.
